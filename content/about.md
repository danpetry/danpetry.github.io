This is a site about my music-related activities. That includes making music,
and music-related programming.

The links on the home page are for:

Github: code and design files for stuff I've made.  
Resident advisor: writing I have done. I haven't done any for a while, I'll do blog
entries if I ever start again.  
Soundcloud: tracks I have written and live set recordings.  
Mixcloud: mixes.

I wrote this site using Pelican.
