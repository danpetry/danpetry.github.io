I used to be able to DJ breaks ok. Breaks are really easy to DJ, they've all
got a predictable structure and loud snares that make them easy to line up with
each other. I've got a lot of newer records I want to play now that are kind of
dusty house through to darker abstract stuff. I'm getting too old to bash out
club tunes.  They're more difficult to mix though, I need to practice.
