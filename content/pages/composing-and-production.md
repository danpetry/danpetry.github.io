Title: Production Ideas
Category: production-ideas

I produce electronic music. Generally, it's electro leaning or melodic, like my
DJing. I like to do things differently and always look for ways to develop my
processes and add new things that are mine alone.
This was an EP released in 2016, through Third Ear recordings, on vinyl and
digital.  [Here's](https://www.discogs.com/Ged-Dry-River/release/9041283) the Discogs
page, and
[here's](https://soundcloud.com/third-ear-recordings/sets/ged-dry-river-ep) the
audio.

It was recorded mostly while living in Guildford, UK. It has on it a Juno-106
which I'd borrowed from a friend at work for some of it. It took a while, and
the tracks really developed quite slowly over time. At one point I was writing
some music before work every day, which helped it to get completed.
