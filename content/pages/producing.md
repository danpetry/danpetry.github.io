Title: Producing

I produce electronic music, mostly danceable in various styles.
[Here](https://soundcloud.com/danielpetry) are the tracks which I've finished
and uploaded over the years.

This was an EP that was released in 2016. It's kind of dark electro/techno.

[Here's](https://soundcloud.com/wildenbrook) some work-in-progress of some
music I'm making as half of a duo called Wildenbrook. Sebastian uses effected
guitars and sings vocals, and writes the chord/vocal components of the songs. I
do drums and synthesisers.
