Title: Producing

I produce electronic music in various styles (mostly danceable ones).
[Here](https://soundcloud.com/danielpetry) is my SoundCloud page, where lives a fairly
large collection of tracks I've written over the years.

This was an EP that was released in 2016. It's dark and moody, and stylistically
somewhere in the area of electro and techno.

[Here's](https://soundcloud.com/wildenbrook) some work-in-progress music of a
duo that I'm half of called Wildenbrook. Sebastian plays heavily effected
guitars and sings vocals, and writes the chord/vocal components of the songs. I
play a drum machine and synthesisers.
