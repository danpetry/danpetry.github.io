Title: This Website
Category: this-website

This website was designed on a piece of paper in my local, and programmed using
a static site generator called Pelican.

It's hosted using GitHub Pages. The repo is
[here](https://github.com/danpetry/danpetry.github.io).

It'll probably continue developing on an ongoing basis.
