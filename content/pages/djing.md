Title: DJing

Credits to [Robin Gower](http://www.infonomics.ltd.uk/about/) for teaching me
to DJ.

Around the early naughties, I used to DJ around London occasionally. Here's
quite a fast, electro/nu-breaks style mix which shows the kind of stuff I was
playing at that time.

Around the early 2010's, I gravitated more towards melodic, interesting house
and techno:
