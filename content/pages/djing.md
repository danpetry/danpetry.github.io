Title: DJing
Category: djing

I played records around London, when I lived there. In the early 2000's, I
played a few times with a rave/free party crew called OCB. After that, I
basically played sporadically at people's birthdays in pubs, and suchlike.

My sets are pretty broad, but often lean toward electro, or melodic
house/techno. I like to play music that is good to listen to on headphones;
that doesn't just make sense solely on the dancefloor.

Some of my sets are [here](https://www.mixcloud.com/danielpetry).
