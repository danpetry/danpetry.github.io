Title: About

I used to have a hard time deciding whether to be an engineer or a musician, so
in the end I didn't.

Software is what I do for a living. You can read about that
[here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danpetry/), if you'd like. This is the space
for my music exploits, though.
[links for each of below categories]
I play, write, write about, and make gadgets for, music. This site is a display
cabinet for these projects; a place to collect them together, take note of
them, and track them as they grow.
