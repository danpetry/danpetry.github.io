Title: About

This is a site about my music-related activities. That includes making music,
and music-related making of techy stuff.

The links on the home page are for:

Soundcloud: tracks I have written and live set recordings.  
Mixcloud: mixes.  
Github: code and design files for stuff I've made.  

I also wrote articles for Resident Advisor for a while. I reviewed music, events
and tech products. You can find the articles I wrote [here](https://www.residentadvisor.net/profile/danielpetry/contrib').

I made this site using Pelican.
