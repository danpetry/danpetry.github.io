Title: About

In this site is a rundown of some of the projects I've done in my life. My main
interests are music and technology, and the projects usually have to do with
those topics, but not always.

The idea is that it's a reminder that I've actually done something with all
this tinkering. Maybe it's of some interest to someone else, too.
