Title: Music Journalism

Here  are some reviews that were written for an electronic music webzine.
They're reviews of albums and singles, live events and club nights, festivals,
and technology. There are a few hundred of them, so I've picked out some of the
ones which I feel turned out the best.

each category: music for real airports, etc...]

My good friend [Kevin Joyner](https://kevinjoyner.com/) set me up with this. In
addition to having a global platform where I could dress my opinions up as
facts, I was lucky enough to enjoy a number of perks. I had a feed of a huge
amount of free unreleased music (most of which was dubious quality). A large
part of my studio is made up of discounted software or hardware. A couple of
times a year, I even got free holidays to festvals in Italy, Ukraine, or
Croatia, to party and, er, review them, or even to ones in flooded fields in
England, where at least I didn't have to pay for the dubious pleasure. The last
of these articles is from a few years ago, because in the end, I often felt
like I was on the "other side", critiquing music rather than making it.

Before that, I did a couple of pieces for my college magazine, and wrote for a
magazine called Base.ad in London, back when paper was still a thing. I still
have copies of them, somewhere. It was basically learning to write in public.
Fortunately, paper magazines don't have a comments section.
