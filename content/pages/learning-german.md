Title: Learning German

We're living in Berlin, so I'm learning German. Mainly, I wanted to take the
opportunity to learn a second language.

More practically, my work is German speaking, and it also comes in very handy
when trying to do basically anything bureaucratic. The finishing point
will probably be either when I move, or when I'm fluent.
