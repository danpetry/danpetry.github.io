Title: Learning German

Since I am living in Berlin, I decided to learn German. Why? I'm not so sure. I
think that more than anything else, I just wanted to take the opportunity to
learn a second language.

Practically speaking, my work is German speaking, and it also comes in very
handy when trying to do basically anything bureaucratic. The finishing point
will be either when I move, or when I'm fluent.
