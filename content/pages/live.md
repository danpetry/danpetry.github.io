Title: Solo Live Set
Category: solo-live-set

Playing live is fun, but I haven't got to do it as much as I'd like. It's a
main goal for me, so far as all this music stuff is concerned.

Currently, as Wildenbrook(link to production), we've got something of a
Stammtisch in my local. We've played a couple of times, we don't get paid, we
get free craft beer, and it's a super comfy bar with nice people and a great
atmosphere. It works for me. We tried a completely improvised set, but this was
more scary than we thought it would be, so we're planning something out now
with more pre-composed elements. There's an excerpt below.

In parallel, I'm working on a live set on my own. This involves lots of
improvisation, too, because I don't learn. The idea so far is an experiment
about electronic counterpoint, or something similar: writing programmed rhythms
in isolation with headphones, of varying lengths, and seeing how they interact
when released into the wild (the speakers). Quite nerdy. Also intended for beer
bars. The Eurorack module (link to making-electronic-instruments) will be an
integral part of this, if I ever get it finished.

Below is the current state of this ambitious endeavour.
