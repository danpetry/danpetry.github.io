## Themes

"Bricks" looks nice and has the bar at the top I was looking for
"Flex" has good functionality, including social media integration and a
sidebar. Looks slightly professional for my needs.
"Nest" looks quite professional and clean
"Twenty-htm5up" looks nice but not really my style - how did he do it? (Also
not working, needs debugging)

all names lower case in the themes directory

Last two look the best.

## cheat sheet

pelican content -t /path/to/theme
pelican --listen
